Let me explain the structure of this template:

Import necessary modules: You can import any required modules at the beginning of your code. Replace module1 and module2 with the actual modules you need.

Define global variables: If you have any global variables that will be used across multiple functions, you can define them here.

Define functions: Define any functions you'll be using in your program. You can define them before the main() function or inside it, depending on your requirements.

Main function: The main() function is where you write the main logic of your program. Replace pass with the actual code you want to execute.

Execute the main function: The if __name__ == "__main__": block ensures that the main() function is executed only when the script is run directly and not when it is imported as a module.

You can customize this template by adding more functions, global variables, or additional module imports based on your specific program requirements.
